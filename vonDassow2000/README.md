# von Dassow et al. (2000) model of segment polarity network

This contains implementations of the segment polarity network of [von Dassow et. al (2000)](https://doi.org/10.1038/35018085) in COPASI. Model construction was done with python scripts using [BasiCO](https://github.com/copasi/basico), the scripts are included here.

 - **1cell** files are for a model that contains the interaction network in a single cell
 - **16cells** files are for a model containing an array of 8x2 hexagonal cells
