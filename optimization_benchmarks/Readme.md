# Optimization benchmarks

This folder includes a series of optimization function benchmarks encoded as COPASI files. They are useful to test the many optimization algorithms contained in COPASI. Each of these files includes a short description of the function and where it was first defined. Functions are encoded as global quantities (assigments) and the optmization is carried out over a time course. The time course is only a way to force calculation of the function value given the parameters, so it is kept to 1 time point only.
